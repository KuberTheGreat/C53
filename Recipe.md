1. Wash rice few times till the water runs clear. Soak in ample amount of water for 30 mins.
Drain and set aside.

2. Bring 2 to 2 half liters water to a boil in a pot or a cooker. Add bay leaf and shahi jeera. 
You can also use cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms. If you so not like to get a bite of the spices 
in the rice, you can also tie these in a muslin cloth and add to the pot.

3. Meanwhile, heat 3 tbsp oil in a biryani pot, handi or pan. Add sliced onions and fry evenly 
until golden.

4. These onions lend a unique and authentic flavour, so do not skip these.

5. When they turn dark brown, set aside one-fourth portion of these fried onions

6. When the water comes to a boil, add salt and drained rice and cook until *al dente* or 90% 
done

7. While the rice cooks, let us make the chicken ready. To the rest of the onions, add 1 small 
bay leaf, star anise, half tsp shahi jeera, 3 cardamoms, 4 cloves. Saute just for a min without 
burning.

8. Add 1 tbsp of __ginger garlic paste__

9. Saute on a medium flame until the raw smell of ginger garlic goes off.

10. Add __*Chicken*__

11. Saute for 2 to 3 mins until the chicken turns white in color. Sprinkle salt.

12. Add biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric and green chilies. I use this __HomeMade 
Biryani Masala__. Just a reminder about the rice, do check it.

13. Mix everything well and fry for 3 mins. After that cover and cook on a low flame for 3 to 4 
mins for the chicken to release the moisture.

14. Add 1 cup thick curd / yogurt.

15. Stir, cover and cook on a medium flame until chicken is soft and tender.

16. While the chicken cooks, check the rice. Drain off the rice to a colander when cooked to al 
dente. The rice must be 90% cooked meaning you must feel the bite when you bite through a rice 
grain. Rice should be firm and grainly but not mushy.

17. When the chicken is cooked completely, a thick gravy is left in the pot with oil seperated. 
Check the salt now and add more if needed. Stir well and sprinkle chopped coriander and pudina 
leaves.

18. Layer the rice over the chicken gravy. Sprinkle fried onions, pudina and coriander leaves. 
You can also add the optional ingredients. 

19. Cover the pot with a foil or a thick clean moist cloth.

20. Cover with a air tight lid to trap the steam or dum. If you do not have a tight lid then you 
can place a heavy pot over the lid. You can mix 1 half cups atta with water and make a dough. 
Stick the dough to the rim of the lid. Press it off on to the pot, for a air tight seal. Place 
this pot on a hot tawa and cook for about 12 to 15 mins on a medium heat. Once done switch off 
and allow to rest for atleast 20 mins.

21. Aromatic __Hydrabadi Chicken Dum Biryani__ is ready.
